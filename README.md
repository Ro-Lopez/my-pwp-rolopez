## Milestone 1 Feedback
Very nice work on your Persona, Use Case, purpose, audience and goal(s). You have a great direction outlined in detail for your freelance development work, and you have a very thoughtful understanding of the needs and frustrations of the client base you're looking to target.

Based on your content here, it looks like you're planning on marketing yourself as a one-stop-shop freelance web developer, digital marketer, and small business consultant. Down the line your website needs will probably be well be beyond the scope of this small project. Given that you are clear regarding your direction and you have a good understanding of the clients you would like to work with I think you're positioned very well to create a great MVP that serves both your needs and those of your end users. With a good design and content strategy you can create a page that will give you a great start. Looking forward to seeing your content strategy and UI design choices in Milestone 2a.

Overall your HTML is looking good - but there were a few technical points I wanted to bring to your attention. See **Edits &amp; Suggestions** below. 

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/) - nice job. You're clear to begin work on [Milestone 2&alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/). Go ahead and read the documentation on bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu, and I will be going over [Milestone 2&alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/) in class on Monday 5/1.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
Really nice work overall with the HTML. There are only a few very minor points I want to nitpick on:
- Using all caps in your HTML tags is very 1997 (lines 4, 84). Nobody does that anymore.
- Place your paragraph content inside &lt;p&gt; tags.
- Don't overuse the &lt;br&gt; tag to space out your content. Use &lt;p&gt; tags, and `margin` or `padding` in CSS instead.
- Delete the empty &lt;header&gt; if it's not serving a purpose.
- Line 4 should be `/node_modules` in your `.gitignore` file. (Just replace the "-" with a "\_")
